1,The Rise of AI,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), originally founded at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956; is transforming [global] industries in 2024! Machine Learning (ML) & Deep Learning (DL) are 'key' components of 21st-century systems; these technologies allow 10,000s of computers to learn from raw data without explicit programming. AI is being used in healthcare (to diagnose 95% of cases) and in finance [detecting fraudulent transactions]. Does AI truly 'think'? No! It simply executes complex mathematical functions. The future of AI holds 100% potential for automation & efficiency across all sectors."
2,Future of Robotics,"Robotics (version 2.5-beta) is advancing rapidly; integrating with AI for [autonomous] systems since the 1990s. Human-robot interaction (HRI) is a 'growing' field; that focuses on how 7.8 billion people and robots work together in shared environments (e.g., factories). Industrial robots [Model-X900] can lift over 500kg; using precise sensors & actuators! The future of robotics involves 'soft' robots; designed for domestic use: cleaning 100% of homes & providing companionship to the elderly. Can robots feel? [Research is ongoing]."
3,Data Engineering,"Data Engineering (DE) leverages tools & computation (e.g., Spark/Hadoop) to move 1,000,000,000+ records daily. Big-data analytics [v4.0] is 'crucial' for 100% business success; insights are gained from massive pipelines. Data engineers build the 24/7 infrastructure; that allows scientists to perform their work. They use technologies like SQL/NoSQL databases; along with cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP). Ensuring 99.9% data quality is a core responsibility; of any modern DE team! (Note: Data is the new oil)."
